# Creating a Project with jluna

The following is a step-by-step guide to creating our own application using `jluna`.

First, we create our workspace directory. For the remainder of this section, this will be assumed to be `~/my_project`. We now execute:

```bash
cd ~/my_project
git clone https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna.git
```

This adds the folder `jluna/` to our directory. We now need to compile `jluna`.
