# jluna: A modern julia <-> C++ Wrapper (v0.8.1)

![](./header.png)

Julia is a beautiful language, it is well-designed, and well-documented. Julias C-API is also well-designed, less beautiful, and much less... documented.
Heavily inspired in design and syntax by (but in no way affiliated with) the excellent Lua тнд C++ wrapper [**sol3**](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2), `jluna` aims to fully wrap the official julia C-API, replacing it in usage in projects with C++ as the host language, by making accessing julias unique strengths through C++ safe, hassle-free, and just as beautiful.

### Showcase
#### Access Julia-Side Values/Functions
```cpp
// execute arbitrary strings with exception forwarding
State::safe_script(R"(
    f(x) = x*x*x
    
    mutable struct MyStruct
        _field
        MyStruct() = new(123)
    end

    instance = MyStruct();
)");

// access and modify variables
Main["instance"]["_field"] = 456;
State::script(R"(println("instance._field is now: ", instance._field))");

// call julia-side functions with C++-side values
int result = Main["f"](12);
Base["println"](result);
```
```
instance._field is now: 456
1728
```
---
#### Multi-Dimensional Array Interface
```cpp
State::script("array = collect(1:9)");
Array<size_t, 1> cpp_array = Main["array"];

// iterable and assignable
for (auto e : cpp_array)
    e = e.operator size_t() + 10;

State::script("println(array)");

// julia style list indexing
auto sub_array = cpp_array[{6, 5, 4, 3, 2}];
Base["println"]((Any*) sub_array);

// even supports comprehension
auto comprehended_vec = Vector<Int64>("(i for i in 1:10 if i % 2 == 0)"_gen);
    Base["println"](comprehended_vec);
```
```
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
[17, 16, 15, 14, 13]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
---
#### Call C++ Functions from julia

```cpp
/// register lambda and bind to julia-side variable
State::new_named_undef("lambda") = [](Any* x, Any* y) -> Any*
{
    auto as_string = unbox<std::string>(x);
    std::cout << "cpp prints " << as_string << " and returns: " << std::endl;
    auto as_set = unbox<std::set<size_t>>(y);

    size_t out = 0;
    for (size_t x : as_set)
        out += x;

    return box(out);
};

// now callable from julia
State::safe_script(R"(
    println(Main.lambda("what julia handed it", Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4])))  # non-c-types work!
)");
```
```
cpp prints what julia handed it and returns: 
10
```
---
#### Exchange Arbitrary Types between States

```cpp
struct NonJuliaType
{
    std::vector<std::string> _field;
};
set_usertype_enabled(NonJuliaType);

// setup usertype interface
Usertype<NonJuliaType>::add_property<Int64>(
    // fieldname
    "_field",
    // getter
    [](NonJuliaType& in) -> Int64 {return in._field01;},
    // setter
    [](NonJuliaType& out, Int64 value) {out._field01 = value;}
);

// create julia-side equivalent type
Usertype<NonJuliaType>::implement();

// can now be moved between Julia and C++
auto cpp_instance = NonJuliaType();
State::new_named_undef("julia_instance") = box<NonJuliaType>(cpp_instance);

jluna::safe_eval(R"(
    push!(julia_instance._field, "new")
    println(julia_instance)
)");
```
```
NonJuliaType(["new"])
```

### Features
Some of the many advantages `jluna` has over the C-API include:

+ expressive, generic syntax
+ automatically detects and links julia
+ call C++ functions from julia using any julia-type
+ assigning C++-side proxies also mutates the corresponding variable julia-side
+ any C++ type can be moved between Julia and C++. Any julia-type can be wrapped
+ multi-dimensional, iterable array interface with julia-style indexing
+ C++-side introspection, deeper than what is possible through only Julia
+ fast! All code is considered performance-critical and was optimized for minimal overhead compared to the C-API
+ julia-side values, including temporaries, are kept safe from the garbage collector
+ verbose exception forwarding, compile-time assertions
+ inline documentation for IDEs, for both C++ and Julia code 
+ verbose manual, written by a human
+ freely mix `jluna` and the C-API
+ And more!

### Planned (but not yet implemented):

(in order of priority, highest first)

+ thread-safety, parallelization
+ linear algebra wrapper, matrices
+ expression proxies
+ multiple julia states, save-states: restoring a previous julia state

## Documentation

A verbose, step-by-step introduction and manual is available [here](./docs/manual.md). Furthermore, all user-facing code has in-line documentation available through most IDEs (or the julia `help?` command). 

Advanced users are encouraged to check the headers (available in `jluna/include/`) for implementation details. They are formatted specifically to be easily understood by 3rd parties. 

---

## Dependencies

`jluna` aims to be as modern as is practical. It uses C++20 features extensively and aims to support the newest julia version, rather than focusing on backwards compatibility. If you are looking for a C++ library that supports julia 1.5 or lower, consider checking out [CxxWrap](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl) instead.

For `jluna` you'll need:
+ [**Julia 1.7.0**](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) (or higher)
+ [**cmake 3.12**](https://cmake.org/download/) (or higher)
+ C++ Compiler (see below)

Currently [**g++10**](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1192955/how-to-install-g-10-on-ubuntu-18-04), [**g++11**](https://lindevs.com/install-g-on-ubuntu/) and [**clang++-12**](https://linux-packages.com/ubuntu-focal-fossa/package/clang-12) are fully supported. g++-11 is the primary compiler used for development of `jluna` and is thus recommended. MSVC is untested but may work.

> *Building on Windows is currently untested, however no part of `jluna`, julia, or cmake is explicitly unix-dependent. This suggests, compilation may work without problem using either clang (recommended) or MSVC.

## [Installation & Troubleshooting](./docs/installation.md)


> A step-by-step guide intended for users unfamiliar with cmake is available [here](./docs/installation.md)

Execute, in any public directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna
cd jluna
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ Compiler>
make install
```

Where 
+ `<C++ Compiler>` is one of `g++-10`, `g++-11`, `clang++-12`

Afterwards, you can make `jluna` available to your library using 

```cmake
# inside your own CMakeLists.txt
find_library(jluna REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(<Your Library> PRIVATE
    "${jluna}" 
    "${<Julia>}")
```
Where 
+ `<Julia>` is the Julia Library (usually available in `"${JULIA_BINDIR}/../lib"`)
+ `<Your Library>` is the name of your library or executable

If errors appear at any point, head to [troubleshooting](./docs/installation.md#troubleshooting).

### Creating a Project from Scratch

`jluna` offers a one-line wizard for installing it  and creating a new project using it.

> this feature is only available on unix systems

To do so, download `init.sh` [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clemapfel/jluna/cmake_rework/install/init.sh). 

Then execute (in the same folder you downloaded `init.sh` to):

```cpp
/bin/bash init.sh <Project Name> <Projects Path> <C++ Compiler>
```
Where
+ `<Project Name>` is the name of your desired project folder, for example `MyProject`
+ `<Projects Path>` is the root path to your new project folder, for example `/home/user/Desktop`
+ `<C++ Compiler>` is one of `g++-10`, `g++-11`, `clang++-12`

The bash script will create a folder in `<Project Path>/<Project Name>`, install jluna in that folder and setup a working hello_world executable for you.

If errors appear at any point, head to [troubleshooting](./docs/installation.md#troubleshooting).

## License

The current and all prior releases of `jluna` are supplied under MIT license, available [here](./LICENSE.txt).

I would like to ask people using this library in commercial or university settings, to disclose their usage of `jluna` in some small way (for example, at the end of the credits or via a citation) and to make clear the origin of the work (for example by linking this github page). Unlike the text in `LICENSE.txt`, this is not a legally binding condition, only a personal request by me, the developer.

For collaboration or further questions, feel free to [contact me](https://www.clemens-cords.com/contact).

Thank you for your consideration, 
C.
